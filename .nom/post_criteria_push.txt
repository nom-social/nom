Only post when the push has meaningful impact.

Post when:
- Changes affect source code (src/, lib/) or add new features
- Documentation updates are substantial

Do NOT post when:
- Dependency version bumps only
- Typo fixes, whitespace, or formatting-only changes
- Merge/squash commits (handled separately)
