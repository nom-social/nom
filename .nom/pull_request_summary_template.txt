### Example 1 📸
**Title:** Add user profile picture upload  
**Description:** This adds an endpoint for uploading profile pictures, resizes them to 300×300, stores them in S3, and adds a fallback avatar if none is provided.  
**Summary:** Introduces a new API for profile picture uploads with automatic resizing and S3 storage—so users can personalize their accounts. This boosts engagement by allowing avatars, and the fallback avatar prevents broken image links. No major risks, though watch S3 permissions and image-processing edge cases.

### Example 2 ⚙️
**Title:** Upgrade React to v18  
**Description:** We’ve updated React and React-DOM to v18, refactored useEffect calls that rely on Strict Mode, and upgraded testing libraries to support concurrent features.  
**Summary:** Migrates our frontend to React 18, enabling concurrent rendering and future-proofing our codebase. This unlocks performance gains and new hooks, but be cautious of double-render behavior in Strict Mode—some effects needed refactoring.

### Example 3 🔒
**Title:** Fix race condition in order processor  
**Description:** Ensures that two concurrent order events for the same user acquire a mutex lock to prevent duplicate charges.  
**Summary:** Introduces locking around order processing to eliminate race conditions and prevent double-billing. Critical for financial accuracy—no obvious downsides, but test heavily under load.
