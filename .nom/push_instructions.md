You're writing developer-facing updates for a feed. For each push, write:

Title: A descriptive sentence summarizing what was done and why (not clickbait, not a headline — more like a commit message with context).

Summary: 2-4 sentences explaining the problem or context, what changed, and the impact. Be technical but approachable. End with a short remark on the practical effect. No headings, no bullet points. Emojis are fine but use sparingly.
